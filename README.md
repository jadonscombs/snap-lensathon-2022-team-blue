# Snap Inc. Lensathon 2022: "Fill-it-In" Card Game
Courtesy of [Snap Inc.](https://www.snap.com/en-US) and [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/), and hosted by [devpost](https://snaplensathon.devpost.com/).

This repository holds our submission for the Snap AR Lensathon 2022 hackathon, which falls under the "Interactive Play" development category.

Special thanks to all team members (wonderful collaborators):

- **Nico** (Project Coordinator and Head Developer)
- **Kalaina** (Creative Prompt Organizer)
- **Dominic** (Core Card Designer)
- **Jadon** (R&D Support and Coordinator)

# Project Overview
Simply put, it's a back-and-forth "fill-in-the-blank" visual card game with friends!

## Key Features
- Animated border to support immersion and enhance design
- Text-based prompt randomizer and generator

## How it Works

1. When using our Lens, a card/speech bubble appears over the user's head, continuously generating random fill-in-the-blank text prompts.

2. The user **raises their eyebrows** to stop and select a randomized text prompt.

3. The user fills in the blank with their funniest/ most unexpected/unique answer.

4. The user takes a selfie with the speech bubble and their answer, and sends it to a friend/recipient.

5. Now the recipient can ~~totally not judge~~ view their friend's prompt and answer, and reply with their own creative prompt-answer selfie!

## Project Demo
Here you'll find a small preview of our Lens in action:
